# IT & Cybersecurity Learning Log

This repository documents what I’m learning about computers, the internet,

I’m not an expert — this is a hands-on learning journal focused on consistency,
curiosity, and understanding how things actually work.

## Why This Repo Exists
I learn best by doing, breaking things, fixing them, and writing things down.
This repo is proof of progress, not perfection.
